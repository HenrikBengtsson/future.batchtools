Package: future.batchtools
==========================

Version: 0.1.0-9000 [2017-02-11]

BUG FIXES:

 o Due to NFS cache delays, the underlying batchtools result files
   may not be available when read. Now value() for BatchtoolsFuture
   tries to trigger an NFS cache synchronization before reading the
   results.


Version: 0.1.0 [2017-02-11]

 o Package created by porting the code of future.BatchJobs.
   This version passes 'R CMD check --as-cran' with all OK
   after a minimial amount of adjustments to the ported code.
