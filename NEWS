Package: future.batchtools
==========================

Version: 0.5.0 [2017-06-02]

 o First version submitted to CRAN.
 
SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 o Added more tests; test coverage now at 93%.
 

Version: 0.4.0 [2017-05-16]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Added batchtools_custom() for specifying batchtools futures using any type
   of batchtools cluster functions.
   
 o batchtools_template(pathname = NULL, type = <type>) now relies on the
   batchtools package for locating the <type> template file.
   
 o nbrOfWorkers() for batchtools futures now defaults to +Inf unless the
   evaluator's 'workers' or 'cluster.functions' specify something else.

 o Renamed argument 'pathname' to 'template' for batchtools_<tmpl>() functions.

BUG FIXES:
   
 o Under plan(batchjobs_*), when being created futures would produce an error
   on "all(is.finite(workers)) is not TRUE" due to an outdated sanity check.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 o TESTS: Added test of future_lapply() for batchtools backends.

 o TESTS: Added optional tests for batchjobs_* HPC schedulers listed in
   environment variable 'R_FUTURE_TESTS_STRATEGIES'.

CODE REFACTORING:

 o CLEANUP: Package no longer depends on R.utils.

 
Version: 0.3.0 [2017-03-19]

NEW FEATURES:

 o The number of jobs one can add to the queues of HPC schedulers is in
   principle unlimited, which is why the number of available workers for such
   batchtools_* backends is reported as +Inf.  However, as the number of
   workers is used by future_lapply() to decide how many futures should be used
   to best partition the elements, this means that future_lapply() will always
   use one future per element.  Because of this, it is now possible to specify
   plan(batchtools_*, workers = n) where 'n' is the target number of workers.


Version: 0.2.0 [2017-02-23]

GLOBALS:

 o batchtools (>= 0.9.2) now supports exporting objects with any type of names
   (previously only possible if they mapped to to strictly valid filenames).
   This allowed me to avoid lots of internal workaround code encoding and
   decoding globals.
   

Version: 0.1.0 [2017-02-11]

 o Package created by porting the code of future.BatchJobs. This version passes
   'R CMD check --as-cran' with all OK after a minimial amount of adjustments
   to the ported code.
