Package: future.batchtools
==========================

Version: 0.1.0-9000 [2017-02-22]

GLOBALS:

 o batchtools (>= 0.9.2) now supports exporting objects with
   any type of names (previously only possible if they mapped to
   to strictly valid filenames).  This allowed me to avoid lots of
   internal workaround code encoding and decoding globals.
   

Version: 0.1.0 [2017-02-11]

 o Package created by porting the code of future.BatchJobs.
   This version passes 'R CMD check --as-cran' with all OK
   after a minimial amount of adjustments to the ported code.
